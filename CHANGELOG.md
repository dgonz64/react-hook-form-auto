# Changelog

## 1.3.14

### Fixed

* `validate` validation will correctly translated return value (`true` for "ok")
* Passing `errorText` to wrapped array handler

## 1.3.13

### Changed

* Array values are overwritten from initialValues instead of appending them.
* Array mode can be overridden in fieldSchema.
* Array field name digs into `_field` string id.

## 1.3.12

### Added

* `getValues()` to the imperative handlers that returns the complete coerced form values
* Tests for the rest of the imperative functions
* Test for controlled components

### Fixed

* Fixed imperative `reset()`

## 1.3.11

### Added

* Allow React 18 as peer dependency

## 1.3.10

### Fixed

* Externals errors with `forceErrors` now work with nested fields.

## 1.3.9

### Added

* Be able to set errors from outside (for example, server) with `forceErrors` param in `Autoform`

## 1.3.8

### Fixed

* Fixed mistake that locked react to 17 in peerDependencies.

## 1.3.7

### Changed

* Updated some modules to fix security advisories
* In webpack, separated mode from minification so there can be no minimized build that is still production like `npm run build:umd`

## 1.3.6

* Put labels in some readme functions
* Allow to add strings to specific language
* Allow to change string base path with `trPathSetBase`
* `<Autoform />`'s `onChange` prop to listen to any document changes
* Renamed skin `render` to `props` to make it clearer. The older `render` still works and I don't plan on deprecating it.

## 1.3.5

* Correct formatting in `docs/schema-onchange.md`
* `setVisible` also prevents field occurrence in the submit results
* Pass correctly `ref` in default skin in order for checkboxes to work

## 1.3.4

### Fixed

* default skin select will receive correct initial values

## 1.3.3

### Added

* Pass `inputRef` to skin function components to allow them to have the value changed without need them to be controlled
* Pass `helperText` to skin function components too. Helps material-ui.

## 1.3.2

### Added

* Tests for schema `onChange`
* Talk about creating errors with `onChange` and test it
* The helper text is specified with `setHelperText` from `onChange`, then schema `helperText` then model translated string `models.<schema>.<field>._helper` then blank.

### Changed

* `FieldPropsOverride`'s `onChange` now works like schema's and receives [form control context](https://github.com/dgonz64/react-hook-form-auto/blob/master/docs/schema-onchange.md#context).
* `onChange` is not considered experimental anymore

### Fixed

* Select type schema `onChange` value passing corrected
* More resilient way to create autofield state control

## 1.3.1

### Fixed

* Stop ignoring `dist` folder

## 1.3.0

### Added

* Compatibility with react-hook-form 7
* [Guide for skin migrations](docs/migrate-1.2-to-1.3.md)
* Inputs are bound individually to errors. That reduces whole form re-renders.
* EXPERIMENTAL: Allows field value reaction with `onChange` in the schema definition. [Documentation](docs/schema-onchange.md)
* Schemas can set a helper text for the field with `helperText`
* (skins) `react-hook-form-auto` now takes care of register and not the skin. The skin will receive `onChange` and `onBlur`
* (skins) Can take care of the logic for controlled components. Just add `controlled: true` to your skin entry and the skin component will receive also `value`.
* (skins) Can choose a name for error field with `nameForErrors` skin attribute

### Changed

* `onErrors` prop of `Autoform` is only called in submit
* label's `for` and field's `id` now include the schema name in order to avoid potential collisions
* `InputWrap` is now in charge of `array` type error display
* Skin documentation was updated
* (skins) `errors` are now only one and it's a string called `errorText`.
* (skins) `array` the fields now unregister removed subobjects
* (internal) `objectTraverse` now supports `returnValue` option that returns the value instead of its context
* (internal) Tests updated for the new DOM layout
* (internal) `componentRender` refactor, separated to `componentRender`, `AutofieldContainer` and `AutoField`
* (internal, important for tests) field names follow the new `react-hook-form` dotted syntax. You can continue to use the bracked syntax in `FieldPropsOverride` for example.
* (internal) `coerceRef` becomes `stateRef` and holds state, not only value. Also its keys are now paths instead of a fully structured doc.

### Fixed

* Make clear in docs that you need version 6 of `react-hook-form` for older versions of this library in the deprecation section
* Uncontrolled components with only update individually when there are errors instead of rendering the whole tree
* `array` type component now unregister
