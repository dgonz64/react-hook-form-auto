#### Bugs

If you find a bug, open an issue. There will be probably needed code samples or, better, a project that reproduces the bug. In any case, provide as much information as you can about the expectations vs reality.

#### Coding

I just need you to follow the style of the file you are changing. If you create a file from scratch you can style it however you want provided it's not an obfuscated code contestant.

If there are involved design ideas, it would be greatly appreciated to be known before the corresponding code.

## Thank you very much!
